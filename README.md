Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends
# Project title: Things to Consider for a Successful Kickstarter Campaign

## Motivation: As a producer I'm always looking for business inteligence to support the work that we do. Sometimes those who are uber passionate about their creative work may be blind sighted when it comes to monetizing their work.

### Purpose: This project is intended to provide guidance and trends to producers looking to launch a successful and competitive Kickstarter Campaign so they may fully realize their financial goals as they look for donors to complete their project. 

## Analysis and Challenges: The challenge lies in understanding the whole story. What can be understood from the data sets that are not included and how we can go about to obtaining that data. The data is based on the request from a client who is looking to launch a Kickstarter campaign to produce a play. Her requirements include analyzing theatre and plays in the U.S. and Great Britian. This data can certainly be built upon for other desired categories.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Based on the data the month of May had the highest number of successful campaigns. However, it is important to note that the numbers for other months didn't show a significant jump or decline. When compared to the failed campaigns the month of July had the highest number in comparison to the other months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: The Theatre campaigns were able to draw the second largest successful dollar amount after Film&Video. The top two categories were Theatre and Film&Video for successful outcomes based on goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: The overall challenges when working with the data sheet is to ensure that you've removed filters otherwise you will be pulling the wrong data into the tables, and although you may be using the correct formulas, it can cause several errors.

## Results:

Outcomes based on launch date may leave you with some general sense of direction, but it would be good to analyze at least 5 - 10 years before drawing a conclusion. However, I'm going to side on the conclusion that people may be more inclined to support a Kickstarter campaign during the months of March to May according to this particular data. It would be interesting to see if these launch dates correlate to any national festivals taking place. The second conclusion is that failed campaigns peaked in January and October and perhaps that may have to do with external factors like Holiday spending.

Further information needs to be reviewed to determine the correlation between the outcomes and goals. It would be great to review two years prior and two years after to determine if the 5 year period is consistent. The Theater category was able to yield a collective amount of $4.4 million.

It isn't clear what other marketing or branding is being done by those who are hosting a successful campaign. Often times people who launch a Kickstarter campaign have already known donors who will boost their campaign so that they reach their goals as they race for time.

It would be good to create a graph displaying the data points comparing the date created vs date ended. And compare the failed vs. the successful campaigns.
